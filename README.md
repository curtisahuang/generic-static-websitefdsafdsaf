# Static Site Template

A minimal, no-build static site template — just open `index.html` and start editing.

A static site can be deployed via the Preview on the toolbar. If you'd like to customise your own url for static sites, you can change your deployment settings under project settings. 

Let's get started!

Add a little relish to your project: try sprinkling in playful copy, thoughtful details, and polished finishing touches.

Static pages breathe
No build steps, just open, write
Pages bloom in light

Hot dog on the grill
Mustard suns and buns embrace
Summer in one bite
